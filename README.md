I am a Software Developer with experience in Javascript, Ruby on Rails, React, React-Native, Node.js and TDD. I have skills in both the front-end and back-end of web applications. I have a background in sales, marketing and also as an entrepreneur with an online business. When I started my business, I had to learn how to build a website to handle transactions. Figuring out how to build an online presence ultimately brought me to my true passion: developing web applications.

I am seeking a role as a Developer at a company where I can hone my skills and collaborate with other developers to build an innovative platform. Ideally, I would work with a creative, talented team that follows best practices like test-driven development and pair programming to help me learn, grow and continue to master the craft.
